A script to add page counts to books on the want-to-read list on Bookclubz.com

Useful for estimating how long a book will take to read.

Issues:
* Due to AJAX loading pages without refreshing, this script currently requires that the page manually be refreshed when navigating from the main book club page.
* Get rid of that godawful setTimeout and replace it with something more robust.
